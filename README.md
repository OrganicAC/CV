## Anthony Chaplin

Junior Full Stack Developer who recently graduated from Maker's Academy, a highly selective 16 week bootcamp. Building upon previous experience in banking and customer services, I have developed many key skills. I am highly collaborative, and frequently take the lead, whether looking after my team at work or making decisions for a project, and also highly capable when working by myself. Working in a bank helped develop me into a fast learner and made me highly adaptable, traits which have been invaluable moving into the tech world.
