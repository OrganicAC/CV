## Anthony Chaplin

Junior Full Stack Developer who recently graduated from Maker's Academy, a highly selective 16 week bootcamp. Building upon previous experience in banking and customer services, I have developed many key skills. I am highly collaborative, and frequently take the lead, whether looking after my team at work or making decisions for a project, and also highly capable when working by myself. Working in a bank helped develop me into a fast learner and made me highly adaptable, traits which have been invaluable moving into the tech world.

## Skills

### Attention to detail

Working at a retail bank meant I needed to have a critical eye for details, ensuring I was keeping an eye out for anything suspicious or fraudulent. This served me well in a transition to coding, helping me keep an eye out for grammar, such as stray semicolons, as well as any bugs. This was exemplified in our final project where we were facing a bug which was causing the game we were working on to not work. By taking the time to comb through the code, I found we had forgotten a full stop that was causing the error, adding it in and fixing the bug.

### Quick Learner

I have always had a thirst for knowledge and enjoyed learning. This is one of the reasons I chose to pursue coding, as I wanted to learn something completely new. Whilst working in the bank processes and procedures would change frequently, sometimes several times in a week, so it was necessary to keep up. Furthermore, I was often praised for my ability to learn quickly, absorbing information and helping my peers to understand. This is no more evident than when one of the bankâ€™s key systems was completely overhauled, necessitating everyone learning the new system. I was able to grasp it very quickly, and in recognition, I was selected as a super user, and sent around to the other contact centres to help train people and familiarise them. I was also present on the day of the launch to help with queries and ensure everything ran smoothly. This has been a huge help moving into the world of tech, as there is a huge amount to learn, and there is always more to know, feeding my thirst for knowledge.

### Empathy

Throughout my life I have always believed soft skills are vitally important. Working in customer services, as well as coaching, means I have been able to put those skills to good use. Before working in a bank I worked with children, allowing me to develop a lot of patience, which also extended into dealing with customers. Coaching allowed me to develop my empathy and teamwork skills, all of which have proved useful whilst at Makers. During our final project, whilst discussing what game engine to use, we found ourselves having disagreements over what the best option was. I made the suggestion to each spend a few minutes and present why we felt our choice was the best, then we take a vote as a group. One person was unhappy with the outcome. Rather than dealing with this in front of the group, I spoke with him separately, listening to his concerns, and explaining why we had voted the way we did. He thanked me for taking the time to speak with him on his own, rather than with the group as a whole, and agreed we should use the engine we selected. By using my empathy and listening, I was able to diffuse a situation that could have caused us tension, and potentially disrupted our work.
